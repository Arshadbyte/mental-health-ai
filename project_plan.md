# Project Plan: AI Mental Health Companion

## Phase 2: Identify Issues and Plan Improvements

Based on the provided project summary, the existing implementation provides a solid foundation. To make this a production-ready and advanced AI Mental Health Companion, we need to focus on the following areas:

### 2.1 Core AI Model Enhancements
- **Improved LLM Integration**: While LM Studio with Mistral/Phi-3 is good for local development, for production, consider more robust and scalable LLM serving solutions (e.g., FastAPI with a dedicated inference server, or cloud-based LLMs if cost allows).
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: The current system uses embeddings for mental health tips. We can enhance this by implementing a more sophisticated RAG pipeline to retrieve relevant information from a broader knowledge base (e.g., medical journals, therapy techniques) and use it to ground the LLM's responses. This will improve the accuracy and relevance of advice.
- **Emotion Detection Refinement**: DeepFace is a good start, but consider integrating more advanced multi-modal emotion detection (e.g., analyzing tone of voice from audio input in addition to facial expressions).
- **Personalized Learning**: Implement mechanisms for the AI to learn from user interactions over time, adapting its responses and suggestions to individual user needs and preferences.

### 2.2 Data Management and Scalability
- **Database Optimization**: While TiDB Cloud is scalable, ensure efficient querying and indexing for large datasets (chat history, mood logs, journal entries). Consider sharding strategies if user base grows significantly.
- **Data Privacy and Security**: Implement robust data encryption (at rest and in transit) and access controls. Ensure compliance with relevant data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA if applicable).
- **User Authentication and Management**: A multi-user system requires a secure authentication mechanism (e.g., OAuth, JWT) and user profile management to store personalized settings and data.

### 2.3 User Experience and Integration
- **Unified User Interface**: Streamlit is great for rapid prototyping, but for a polished production app, consider a more customizable frontend framework (e.g., React, Vue.js) for a richer UI/UX.
- **Robust WhatsApp Integration**: Ensure the Twilio + Flask integration is robust, handles various message types, and provides reliable delivery and error handling.
- **Comprehensive Notification System**: Beyond simple reminders, implement a flexible notification system that can deliver alerts via WhatsApp, email, or in-app, based on user preferences and triggers (e.g., mood changes, inactivity).
- **Advanced Sleep and Breathing Coach**: Integrate more sophisticated tracking for sleep (e.g., integration with wearables) and guided breathing exercises with real-time feedback.

### 2.4 Deployment and Monitoring
- **Containerization (Docker)**: Package the application and its dependencies into Docker containers for consistent deployment across different environments.
- **Orchestration (Kubernetes)**: For large-scale deployments, consider Kubernetes for managing and scaling the application containers.
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Implement a Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment pipeline for automated testing and deployment.
- **Monitoring and Logging**: Set up comprehensive monitoring (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana) and centralized logging (e.g., ELK stack) to track application performance, identify issues, and gather insights.

### 2.5 Error Handling and Resilience
- **Graceful Degradation**: Ensure the application remains functional even if certain components (e.g., external APIs, LLM server) are temporarily unavailable.
- **Robust Error Logging**: Implement detailed error logging and alerting to quickly identify and address issues.

This plan will guide the subsequent phases of development, focusing on building a high-quality, scalable, and user-friendly AI Mental Health Companion.
